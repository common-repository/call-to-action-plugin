**Forget trying to attract an audience through interruption-based marketing (popups, slide-ins, bars, random text, etc.).** It doesn't work. Visitors would sooner leave than be bombarded by those kind of ads. 

This plugin is what you've been searching for and features everything you need to customize to your taste. 

At its core, **this plugin was designed to flow with your blog theme and provide your audience with a 'call to action'** when they get to the end of your blog post. Obviously, you want them to "do something" after they have read your post, right?
